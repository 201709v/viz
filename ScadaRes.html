        <p align="justify">Network communication (local and remote):
            SCADA networks employ several communication
            methods. Short-range communication utilizes serial
            communication, USB, and custom wired networks.
            Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiFi, dial-up networking,
            cellular packet data, and other protocols are utilized
            for long-distance communication. In addition,
            SCADA networks increasingly employ the Internet
            for long-distance communication and remote
            access</p>
